# Stock Price Prediction

ðŸ“Š This project aims to predict stock prices using machine learning models, primarily linear regression. The data is sourced from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` API.

## Features
- Fetches historical stock price data using `yfinance`.
- Predicts stock prices using machine learning techniques like linear regression and Support Vector Regressor (SVR). 
- Simple and effective solution to analyze stock trends and forecast future prices.ðŸ“ˆ

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do so by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install yfinance numpy scikit-learn

ðŸ“Œ In summary, this project is a good starting point for exploring stock price prediction, but it has significant limitations in terms of reliability for professional uses. It is simple to use and useful for learning the basics of financial data analysis and machine learning. However, to improve its reliability and usefulness in real-world scenarios, it would be necessary to add more advanced models and more rigorous performance evaluations ðŸ“Œ
